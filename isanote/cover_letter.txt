Dear Prof Bateman, Prof Valencia,

please find attached our manuscript for 
an application note, entitled 'Modular analysis
of gene expression data with R'.

The software introduced by the paper is an 
implementation of the Iterative Signature Algorithm 
(ISA), a biclustering method that finds transcription
modules in gene expression data. (Bi-)clustering 
is an approach to reduce the complexity of large
data sets and currently ISA is one of the state
of the art algorithms. See e.g. Prelic et al. 
(2006) [1] and Richards et al. (2008) [2] for 
independent evaluations of the ISA.

So far the ISA lacked an extensively 
documented, efficient, open-source implementation. 
We think that our software facilitates data 
analysis and makes ISA modular analysis a quick 
routine procedure. As our implementation is 
built on R and BioConductor, it fits smoothly
into existing analysis pipelines, and works for 
any organism supported by BioConductor. Manuals 
and tutorials are included both in the software 
package itself and at the ISA homepage [3].

Sincerely Yours,
Gabor Csardi
