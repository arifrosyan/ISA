<h2>The Iterative Signature Algorithm</h2>

<p>
The Iterative Signature Algorithm (ISA) finds transcription modules,
i.e. biclusters in gene expression data sets, or other numeric
matrices. The ISA was developed to find modules of differentially
co-expressed genes. A group of genes are differentially co-expressed
if they all have higher expression than the rest, in the same subset
of samples. (Or, alternatively, they all have lower expression than
the rest.) See the various publications below for more about the ISA.

<p>
We have developed several R packages to perform the modular analysis
of gene expression data.

<h2>ExpressionView</h2>

<p>
ExpressionView is an R package that provides an interactive
environment to explore biclusters identified in gene expression
data. A sophisticated ordering algorithm is used to present the
biclusters in a visually appealing layout that provides an intuitive
summary of the results. From this overview, the user can select
individual biclusters and access all the biologically relevant data
associated with it. The package is aimed to facilitate the
collaboration between bioinformaticians and life scientists who are
not familiar with the R language.

<h2>TargetScan miRNA target prediction in BioConductor</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.targetscan.org">TargetScan</a> is a database of
  predicted miRNA targets, developed at the Whitehead Institute for
  Biomedical Research. To facilitate the use of this database in
  <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">BioConductor</a> we created
  annotation R packages from it.
