Dear Prof Bateman, Prof Valencia,

please find attached our manuscript for
an application note, entitled 'ExpressionView 
-- an interactive viewer for modules identified 
in gene expression data'.

The software discussed in this paper is an
interactive visualization tool for overlapping 
biclusters. Biclustering is an approach to 
reduce the complexity of gene expression data 
from many samples by finding genes with 
similar expression profiles, over a subset of 
the samples. ExpressionView works with the 
output of many biclustering algorithm and 
works especially well with the Iterative
Signature Algorithm (ISA) [1,2].

As our implementation is built on R and 
BioConductor, it fits smoothly into existing 
analysis pipelines, and works for any organism 
supported by BioConductor. Manuals and tutorials 
are included both in the software package itself 
and online [3].

We believe that ExpressionView fills a gap, 
and provides a solution to a challenging 
visualization problem. 

Sincerely Yours,
Gabor Csardi
